Hello MySportsFeeds Support Team,

I'm reaching out regarding an access issue I'm experiencing with the MySportsFeeds API v2.1. I'm being told I have all the necessary access, but I'm receiving a 403 "Access Restricted" error when attempting to fetch NFL player game logs.

## Error Details

**HTTP Status:** 403 Forbidden
**Error Message:**
```
"Your authentication is okay. However, one or more of the following may have happened:
- You forgot to add a relevant subscription to your API Key
- Your API Key supports v1.x requests only
- You may be requesting a data feed that requires an ADDON"
```

## What I'm Trying to Access

**Endpoint:** `https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nfl/2024-2025-regular/week/8/player_gamelogs.json`

**API Key:** `1a57a836-08b4-4cec-bec1-8f3a8f` (first 36 characters)

**Use Case:** I'm building a fantasy football platform for XL Benefits and need to fetch weekly player statistics to calculate scores for our participants.

## What I've Confirmed

✅ **Authentication is working** - The API recognizes my credentials
✅ **API Key and Password are correct** - No 401 errors
✅ **Request format is correct** - Using proper Basic Auth header
✅ **Endpoint URL is valid** - Following v2.1 documentation

❌ **Cannot access NFL player game logs** - Getting 403 error

## Testing Details

I tested the following endpoints with the same result:

1. **Players List (Test Connection):**
   - URL: `https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nfl/players.json?limit=1`
   - Result: ❌ 403 Forbidden

2. **Player Game Logs (Main Use Case):**
   - URL: `https://api.mysportsfeeds.com/v2.1/pull/nfl/2024-2025-regular/week/8/player_gamelogs.json`
   - Result: ❌ 403 Forbidden

## My Questions

1. **Is my API Key v2.x compatible?**
   If it's only v1.x, I'll need to create a new key.

2. **Do I have the NFL subscription/addon active?**
   The error mentions this might be missing.

3. **What specific subscription level do I need?**
   I need access to:
   - Player game logs (weekly stats)
   - Passing, rushing, receiving stats
   - Kicker stats (field goals, PATs)
   - Defense stats (TDs, interceptions, sacks)

4. **Is there a way to verify my current subscription/addons?**
   I'd like to confirm what I have access to.

## Account Information

**API Key:** 1a57a836-08b4-4cec-bec1-8f3a8f...
**Organization:** XL Benefits
**Project:** Fantasy Football Platform for broker partners

## Request

Could you please:
1. Check if my API key has the required NFL v2.x access
2. Verify what subscription/addons are currently active
3. Confirm if I need to upgrade or add any specific addons
4. Let me know if I need to generate a new v2.x compatible API key

I'd appreciate any guidance on resolving this access issue. If there's additional subscription information or account settings I need to configure, please let me know.
