# Security Audit Report - XL Benefits System
*Date: October 29, 2024*

## Executive Summary

This security audit has identified **11 critical vulnerabilities** and **9 important security concerns** in the XL Benefits system. The most severe issues include missing authentication on admin endpoints, hardcoded credentials, and potential SQL injection vectors.

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Immediate remediation recommended before production deployment.

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

### 1. Missing Admin Authentication on API Endpoints
**Severity: CRITICAL**
**CVSS: 9.8**
**Location:** Multiple admin API routes

All admin endpoints lack authentication checks:
- `/api/admin/rounds/[roundId]/generate-draft-pool/route.ts:23`
- `/api/admin/rounds/[roundId]/send-invites/route.ts:21`
- `/api/admin/draft-pools/update-elite/route.ts:18`

```typescript
// TODO: Add admin authentication check here
// For now, assuming admin access
```

**Impact:** Anyone can:
- Generate/manipulate draft pools
- Send mass emails to all users
- Modify elite player designations
- Access sensitive user data

**Recommendation:** Implement server-side authentication middleware immediately.

---

### 2. Hardcoded Admin Password in Frontend
**Severity: CRITICAL**
**CVSS: 9.1**
**Location:** `app/admin/page.tsx:22`

```typescript
if (password === process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD || password === 'xlb2024admin') {
  localStorage.setItem('adminAuth', 'true');
  router.push('/admin/dashboard');
}
```

**Issues:**
- Hardcoded fallback password: `xlb2024admin`
- Client-side authentication only
- Password visible in browser source code
- localStorage can be manually set by anyone

**Impact:** Complete admin access bypass

---

### 3. Exposed Service Role Key in Environment
**Severity: CRITICAL**
**CVSS: 8.6**
**Location:** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` usage

The service role key bypasses Row Level Security (RLS) and should never be exposed to the client. Current implementation risks exposure through:
- Client-side code bundles
- Browser developer tools
- Network requests

**Recommendation:**
- Never use service role key in client-accessible code
- Implement proper backend API routes
- Use anon key for client-side operations

---

### 4. SQL Injection Risk in Player Name Lookup
**Severity: HIGH**
**CVSS: 8.2**
**Location:** `app/api/lineup/submit/route.ts:86`

```typescript
.ilike('name', playerValue)  // playerValue comes directly from user input
```

While Supabase provides some protection, the `ilike` operation with unsanitized input poses risks.

**Recommendation:**
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement input validation

---

### 5. Missing CORS Configuration
**Severity: HIGH**
**CVSS: 7.5**
**Location:** All API routes

No CORS headers configured, allowing any origin to make requests.

**Impact:**
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Data theft from malicious sites
- Unauthorized API access

**Recommendation:** Configure strict CORS policy:
```typescript
headers: {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, GET, OPTIONS',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization'
}
```

---

### 6. Weak Session Management
**Severity: HIGH**
**CVSS: 7.3**
**Location:** Fantasy Football sessions

Issues identified:
- 42-day session duration (too long)
- No session rotation after submission
- Token stored in cookie alongside session data
- No session invalidation mechanism

**Recommendation:**
- Reduce session lifetime to 24 hours
- Rotate tokens after use
- Implement session revocation
- Store only session ID in cookie

---

### 7. Insufficient Rate Limiting
**Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH**
**CVSS: 6.5**
**Location:** `lib/api/security/rate-limiter.ts`

Current implementation:
- In-memory storage (lost on restart)
- No distributed rate limiting
- Easily bypassed with distributed attacks
- Default 20 requests/minute may be too high

**Recommendation:**
- Implement Redis-based rate limiting
- Add progressive delays
- Lower limits for sensitive endpoints
- Add IP-based blocking for repeated violations

---

### 8. Exposed API Keys in Frontend
**Severity: HIGH**
**CVSS: 7.1**
**Location:** Environment variables

Multiple `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` API keys exposed:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`

While some are meant to be public, sensitive configuration should never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

---

## üü° IMPORTANT SECURITY CONCERNS

### 9. No Input Sanitization for Write-In Players
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**Location:** `app/api/lineup/submit/route.ts`

User-provided player names are inserted directly into the database without sanitization, risking:
- XSS attacks if displayed without encoding
- Database pollution with malicious content

---

### 10. Cron Job Authentication Weakness
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**Location:** `app/api/cron/process-conflict-jobs/route.ts:24`

Simple authorization header check without proper verification:
```typescript
const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization')
```

---

### 11. Missing Content Security Policy (CSP)
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**Impact:** XSS vulnerability amplification

No CSP headers configured, allowing:
- Inline scripts execution
- External resource loading
- Data exfiltration

---

### 12. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
**Severity: MEDIUM**
**Location:** Multiple endpoints using direct IDs

User IDs, round IDs, and team IDs are used directly without ownership verification.

---

### 13. No Audit Logging for Admin Actions
**Severity: MEDIUM**

Critical admin actions are not logged:
- Draft pool generation
- Elite player modifications
- Email sending
- User deletions

---

### 14. Weak Email Verification
**Severity: LOW-MEDIUM**

Magic links can be:
- Reused if intercepted
- Guessed with enough attempts
- Used by anyone with the link

---

### 15. Client-Side Data Validation Only
**Severity: MEDIUM**

Several forms rely solely on client-side validation:
- Elite player limits
- Lineup composition rules
- Calculator inputs

---

### 16. Sensitive Data in Git Repository
**Severity: MEDIUM**

`.env.example` contains actual API key patterns that could aid attackers.

---

### 17. No Security Headers
**Severity: MEDIUM**

Missing headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security`

---

### 18. Predictable Token Generation
**Severity: LOW-MEDIUM**
**Location:** `lib/auth/magic-link.ts:8`

While using `crypto.randomBytes`, consider adding additional entropy sources.

---

### 19. No API Versioning
**Severity: LOW**

No versioning strategy for API endpoints complicates security updates.

---

### 20. Development Credentials in Code
**Severity: MEDIUM**

Hardcoded development credentials found:
- Default admin password
- Test API endpoints
- Debug flags

---
