You didn't get into health insurance to push the same policies year after year. You became a broker because you love helping people—solving real problems for employers who trust you to find creative solutions.

But here's the challenge: You know self-funding could be transformational for some of your clients, but you're not sure who's ready. And without clarity, it's hard to lead that conversation with confidence.

That's where the Self-Funding Readiness Assessment from XL Benefits comes in.

It's a free online tool that gives you an instant readiness score for your clients—zero to one hundred—based on five key factors: group size, cash flow stability, risk tolerance, claims data access, and administrative capabilities.

Within minutes, you get an executive summary highlighting their strengths, areas for improvement, and specific next steps. Every report is co-branded with your logo and theirs—a polished, professional PDF you can present with pride.

This assessment gives you the confidence to explore self-funding with clients who've been with you for years, or that new prospect you're really trying to impress. It positions you as the forward-thinking advisor they need, not just another quote provider.

Visit xlbenefits.com and try the Self-Funding Readiness Assessment with a client today. Help them discover what's possible—and be the broker you set out to be.

XL Benefits. Empowering you to serve with excellence.
