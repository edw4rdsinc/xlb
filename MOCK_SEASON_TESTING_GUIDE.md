# Mock Season Testing Guide

## üéØ Purpose
Test the complete fantasy football system with 3 users (You, Joe, Daron) for a few weeks before rolling out to all 72 participants.

## üë• Test Participants

1. **Your Email** - (add your email)
2. **Joe Landziak** - jlandziak@xlbenefits.com
3. **Daron Pitts** - dpitts@xlbenefits.com

## ‚úÖ Scoring Persistence & Accessibility Verified

### How Scoring Works

**Data Flow:**
```
Week Ends (Monday Night)
  ‚Üì
Tuesday: Run sync_nfl_stats.py
  ‚Üì
Stats saved to player_weekly_stats table (PERSISTENT)
  ‚Üì
Users can view scores via magic links
  ‚Üì
Scores displayed in 3 places:
  1. Lineup submission page (shows your players' weekly points)
  2. Results page (weekly/round/season leaderboards)
  3. Rosters page (all lineups with scores)
```

**Persistence:** All scores are stored in Supabase database tables:
- `player_weekly_stats` - Individual player points per week
- `weekly_scores` - Team total points per week (calculated from lineup)
- Data persists indefinitely and can be viewed at any time

### Magic Links Are Reusable ‚úì

**After Lineup Submission:**
1. User clicks magic link ‚Üí sees success screen
2. Can click "View Results" to see leaderboard
3. Can bookmark magic link and return anytime
4. Magic link remains valid for 7 days (even after submission)
5. Form shows:
   - Locked lineup (cannot be changed)
   - All selected players
   - Weekly points next to each player (Tuesdays onward)
   - Total team score

**Links Already Sent:**
- Joe: https://xlb.vercel.app/fantasy-football/submit?token=ugrH67F6EgKU00jjmOCw4fjjlDQW718wPXfpxG_wjdA
- Daron: https://xlb.vercel.app/fantasy-football/submit?token=DNB8oQjN-mxcRJmzRrWM2sGHWU_34CZHHAuP7N-CDHY

## üìÖ Week-by-Week Testing Plan

### Week 1: Setup & Lineup Submission (Current Week)

**Tasks:**
1. ‚úÖ Send magic links to all 3 test users (DONE via Nylas)
2. Have each user submit their lineup
3. Verify lineups are locked after submission
4. Confirm magic links still accessible after submission

**Success Criteria:**
- All 3 lineups submitted and saved to database
- Forms show as locked when revisiting magic link
- No errors during submission

### Week 2: First Scoring Test

**Monday Night (after games):**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/github-repos/xlb/xlb
source scripts/venv/bin/activate
python scripts/sync_nfl_stats.py --week 7 --season 2024
deactivate
```

**Tuesday:**
1. Check that stats imported successfully:
   - Visit `/admin/scoring` to verify stats in database
   - Or query database: `SELECT * FROM player_weekly_stats WHERE week_number = 7 LIMIT 10;`

2. **Test Score Viewing:**
   - Each user clicks their magic link
   - Verify weekly points appear next to player names (green badges: "15.3 pts")
   - Check Results page: `/fantasy-football/results`
   - Verify Weekly Results tab shows all 3 teams with scores
   - Check leaderboard ranking is correct

**Success Criteria:**
- Stats sync completes without errors
- All 3 users can see their weekly scores via magic link
- Leaderboard displays correct rankings
- Tie-breaker rules work (DEF points, then K points)

### Week 3: Scoring Persistence Test

**Monday Night:**
```bash
source scripts/venv/bin/activate
python scripts/sync_nfl_stats.py --week 8 --season 2024
deactivate
```

**Tuesday:**
1. Verify Week 7 scores still visible
2. Verify Week 8 scores appear
3. Check Round 2 standings accumulate both weeks
4. Test sorting/filtering on Results page

**Success Criteria:**
- Week 7 scores persist and remain visible
- Week 8 scores added correctly
- Round totals = Week 7 + Week 8 combined
- All users can access both weeks via magic links

### Week 4 (Optional): Full System Test

**Complete all features:**
- Weekly winner announcement ($25)
- Round standings (if Round 2 ends)
- Test search functionality on Results page
- Verify all 3 magic links still work after multiple weeks

## üõ†Ô∏è Admin Testing Checklist

### Stats Sync Process
```bash

cd ~/Documents/github-repos/xlb/xlb
source scripts/venv/bin/activate

# 2. Sync specific week (Tuesdays after MNF)
python scripts/sync_nfl_stats.py --week 7 --season 2024

# 3. Check output for errors
# Should see:
# - "‚úÖ Fetched 400+ player stats"
# - "‚úÖ Matched X players to database (85%+ similarity)"
# - "‚úÖ Calculated fantasy points using PPR scoring"
# - "‚úÖ Upserted X stats to Supabase"

# 4. Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

### Database Queries (Verification)

**Check player stats imported:**
```sql
SELECT
  p.name,
  p.position,
  p.team,
  pws.week_number,
  pws.calculated_points
FROM player_weekly_stats pws
JOIN players p ON pws.player_id = p.id
WHERE pws.week_number = 7
ORDER BY pws.calculated_points DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Check team scores calculated:**
```sql
SELECT
  u.team_name,
  ws.week_number,
  ws.total_points,
  ws.qb_points,
  ws.rb1_points,
  ws.rb2_points,
  ws.wr1_points,
  ws.wr2_points,
  ws.te_points,
  ws.k_points,
  ws.def_points
FROM weekly_scores ws
JOIN lineups l ON ws.lineup_id = l.id
JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id
WHERE ws.week_number = 7
ORDER BY ws.total_points DESC;
```

**Check all magic links:**
```sql
SELECT
  u.name,
  u.email,
  u.team_name,
  ml.token,
  ml.expires_at,
  ml.created_at
FROM magic_links ml
JOIN users u ON ml.user_id = u.id
JOIN rounds r ON ml.round_id = r.id
WHERE r.is_active = true;
```

**Check lineups submitted:**
```sql
SELECT
  u.name,
  u.team_name,
  l.submitted_at,
  l.qb_id,
  l.rb1_id,
  l.rb2_id
FROM lineups l
JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id
WHERE l.round_id = '4a4a8d7d-dead-4181-9a30-abfa8f59412f'; -- Round 2 ID
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Stats Not Appearing After Sync

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Python script ran successfully
python scripts/sync_nfl_stats.py --week 7 --dry-run
# Look for error messages in output

# Verify player matching
# Script should show 85%+ match rate
# If low, check player names in database vs nflreadpy
```

### Issue: Weekly Points Not Showing on Form

**Checks:**
1. Is it Tuesday or later? (Sunday-Monday scores hidden)
2. Check current week calculation (based on Sept 4, 2025 season start)
3. Verify `player_weekly_stats` has data for that week

**Fix:**
```javascript
// In submit/page.tsx, check:
const dayOfWeek = today.getDay(); // Should be 2+ for Tuesday
const currentWeek = Math.min(Math.floor(daysSinceStart / 7) + 1, 18);
console.log({ dayOfWeek, currentWeek, showWeeklyScores });
```

### Issue: Magic Link Expired

**Solution:**
```bash
# Regenerate magic link
scripts/venv/bin/python scripts/send_magic_link_nylas.py
# Update users array in script first
```

### Issue: Lineup Not Locked After Submission

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM lineups WHERE user_id = 'USER_UUID' AND round_id = 'ROUND_UUID';
```

If lineup exists but form not locking, check `checkForExistingLineup()` function in submit/page.tsx.
