  // FUNDING MODELS
  {
    term: 'Self-Funded Plan',
    slug: 'self-funded-plan',
    category: 'Funding Models',
    definition: 'A financing arrangement in which an employer assumes the direct financial risk for providing healthcare benefits to its employees. Rather than paying a fixed premium to an insurance carrier, the employer (plan sponsor) pays for each medical and pharmacy claim as it is incurred. The employer collects contributions from enrollees and combines them with corporate funds to pay healthcare claims. This approach grants significant control over plan design, allowing customization of benefits, provider networks, and cost-sharing structures. Self-funded plans are primarily governed by ERISA and are exempt from most state insurance laws and premium taxes.',

    term: 'Fully-Insured Plan',
    slug: 'fully-insured-plan',
    category: 'Funding Models',
    definition: 'The traditional model of employer-sponsored health coverage where the employer contracts with a licensed insurance carrier and pays a fixed, predetermined premium (typically monthly). In exchange, the insurance carrier assumes full financial and legal liability for all covered medical claims and administrative costs. The key differentiator is the transfer of risk: the employer transfers the risk of high claims to the carrier, resulting in predictable costs but eliminating the opportunity to benefit directly from favorable claims experience.',

    term: 'Level-Funded Plan',
    slug: 'level-funded-plan',
    category: 'Funding Models',
    definition: 'A hybrid financing model that blends the cost-saving potential of self-funding with the budget predictability of fully-insured plans. The employer pays a fixed monthly amount that bundles estimated claims costs, administrative fees, and integrated stop-loss insurance. The employer is technically self-funding the claims portion. If actual claims are lower than the funded amount, the employer receives a refund of the surplus. If claims exceed the funded amount, integrated stop-loss insurance covers the excess. This structure is often positioned as an ideal stepping-stone for smaller employers transitioning to self-funding.',

    definition: 'A variation of self-funding where the employer and an insurance carrier agree that the employer will directly pay all claims up to a specified aggregate funding level. The carrier\'s liability begins only after total claims exceed this threshold. The insurer typically provides claims processing and administrative services for the entire plan. Because the employer retains the majority of claims risk below the attachment point, MPPs are categorized as self-insured plans for regulatory purposes.',

    definition: 'The core financial risk retained by a self-funded employer, representing direct payments for medical and pharmacy claims submitted by employees and dependents. Unlike fixed costs, these expenses are inherently unpredictable and can fluctuate dramatically from month to month.

This forecast is based on the group\'s historical claims experience (credibility), demographic makeup of the employee population (age, gender, location), and plan design specifics (deductibles, copayments).

The number of claimants with costs greater than $250,000 has nearly doubled since 2015. HCCs can represent up to 35% of a plan\'s total healthcare costs and are a primary driver of financial volatility and a significant concern for self-funded employers.',

IBNR represents a significant financial liability arising from the inherent "lag" in the claims payment cycleâ€”the period between when service is rendered and when the claim is submitted, processed, and paid.

In employee benefits, an employer can form a captive insurance subsidiary to formalize its self-insured risk. Instead of simply retaining risk on its balance sheet, the employer pays a premium to its own captive, which acts as the insurer for a defined risk layer.

    definition: 'A tax-advantaged personal savings account that an individual can use to pay for qualified medical expenses. To be eligible to contribute to an HSA, an individual must be enrolled in a qualified High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). HSAs offer a triple tax advantage: contributions are tax-deductible, the funds grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. The account is owned by the employee and is portable, meaning the funds remain with the employee even if they change jobs or leave the workforce. Both the employee and the employer can contribute to an HSA, up to an annual limit set by the IRS.',

The employer sets the rules for the HRA, including the annual contribution amount and what expenses are eligible for reimbursement. Funds left in an HRA at the end of the year can often be rolled over to the next year, but the account is not portable and is forfeited if the employee leaves the company.',

Because the contributions are made before taxes are calculated, FSAs reduce an employee\'s taxable income. The primary drawback of an FSA is the "use-it-or-lose-it" rule: funds not used by the end of the plan year (or a short grace period, if offered) are generally forfeited to the employer.',
