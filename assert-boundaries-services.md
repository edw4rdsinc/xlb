Compassionate, evidence-based therapy for adults navigating trauma, boundaries, and life's challenges

### What I Treat

Individual therapy for adults experiencing:

- **Trauma and PTSD** — Processing past experiences that continue to impact your present
- **Boundary Issues** — Learning to assert your needs and protect your emotional space
- **Hoarding Disorder** — PhD-level specialized treatment for hoarding behaviors and underlying issues

### What to Expect

**Session Format:**
- 50-minute individual sessions
- Weekly or bi-weekly frequency (based on your needs)
- Telehealth and in-person options available
- HIPAA-compliant video platform for remote sessions

**Therapeutic Approaches:**
I integrate multiple evidence-based approaches tailored to your specific needs:

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** — Identifying and shifting unhelpful thought patterns that fuel anxiety, depression, or avoidance
- **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)** — Processing traumatic memories at the neurological level to reduce emotional reactivity
- **Trauma-Informed Care** — Recognizing how past trauma shapes current struggles and creating safety in the therapeutic relationship

- **Hoarding-Specific Interventions** — Specialized protocols for hoarding disorder developed through PhD-level research

**Your First Session:**
In our initial session, we'll:
1. Discuss what brought you to therapy and what you're hoping to achieve
2. Explore your history, strengths, and challenges
3. Collaboratively develop a personalized treatment plan
4. Answer any questions you have about the therapeutic process
5. Establish goals and expectations for our work together

### Who This Is For

Individual therapy with me is a good fit if you:
- Are an adult (18+) seeking compassionate, nonjudgmental support
- Want a therapist who understands the cultural context of your experiences
- Are ready to do the work of healing (it's not always easy, but it's worth it)
- Value evidence-based approaches that actually create change
- Want a collaborative therapeutic relationship where your voice matters

**Especially for People of Color:**
If you're a person of color seeking therapy, you know how rare it is to find a therapist who truly gets it — someone who understands code-switching, microaggressions, intergenerational trauma, and the unique stressors we face.

You won't have to explain yourself here. I bring both clinical expertise and lived experience to our work together.

**Fees:**
- Individual Therapy Session (50 min): $[TBD]
