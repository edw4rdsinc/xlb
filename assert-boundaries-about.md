## My Story Section

**Section Headline:**
From Personal Journey to Professional Calling

**Body Copy:**

My path to becoming a therapist wasn't a straight line — it was shaped by lived experience, cultural identity, and a deep commitment to creating the kind of care I wish had been more readily available.

Growing up, I witnessed how mental health challenges can intersect with cultural identity, community expectations, and systemic barriers. I saw how difficult it was for people of color to find therapists who truly understood their experiences — not just clinically, but culturally and emotionally.

That realization became my calling.

### Why I Specialized in Hoarding Disorder

During my doctoral studies, I became fascinated by hoarding disorder — not just as a clinical diagnosis, but as a deeply human struggle that often intersects with trauma, loss, and emotional overwhelm. I saw how people suffering from hoarding were often misunderstood, judged, and left without adequate support.

I dedicated my PhD research to understanding hoarding disorder at the deepest level, studying evidence-based interventions and developing compassionate, effective treatment approaches. Today, I'm one of the few therapists in the Pacific Northwest with PhD-level expertise in this area.

### Why Clinical Supervision Matters to Me

As a therapist of color, I know firsthand the unique challenges we face in this profession. From navigating predominantly white professional spaces to managing the emotional toll of serving communities that share our lived experiences, the journey can feel isolating.

That's why I'm passionate about providing clinical supervision for emerging therapists of color. I want to be the mentor I wish I'd had — someone who understands both the clinical work and the cultural complexity we navigate every day.

When you work with me as a supervisee, you're not just getting clinical guidance. You're getting support rooted in shared experience, cultural understanding, and a genuine commitment to your professional growth.

## My Approach Section

**Section Headline:**
How I Work: Four Core Principles

### 1. Cultural Attunement

**Body Copy:**
Your cultural background isn't something we work around — it's something we honor and integrate into our therapeutic work. I recognize that healing happens within cultural context, and I bring that awareness to every session.

Whether we're addressing trauma, boundaries, or hoarding, I understand how cultural values, family dynamics, and community expectations shape your experience. You won't have to explain yourself or translate your lived experience. I get it.

### 2. Nonjudgmental Support

**Body Copy:**
Therapy should be a place where you can show up exactly as you are — messy, uncertain, struggling, hopeful, all of it. I provide a safe, accepting space where there's no judgment, only compassion and understanding.

If you're dealing with hoarding, boundary issues, or trauma, you've likely experienced shame or stigma. That stops here. In our work together, you'll find acceptance, validation, and genuine support.

### 3. Evidence-Based Practice

**Body Copy:**
While warmth and cultural competence are essential, so is clinical effectiveness. I use proven therapeutic methods that create real, lasting change:

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** — Helping you identify and shift unhelpful thought patterns
- **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)** — Processing trauma at the neurological level
- **Trauma-Informed Care** — Recognizing how past experiences shape present struggles
- **Hoarding-Specific Interventions** — Evidence-based approaches developed through PhD-level research

Every approach I use is backed by research and tailored to your unique needs.

### 4. Collaborative Partnership

**Body Copy:**
You're the expert on your own life. I'm here as a guide, not as someone who tells you what to do.

We'll work together to:
- Define what healing means for you
- Set goals that reflect your values and priorities
- Monitor progress and adjust our approach as needed
- Celebrate wins and navigate setbacks as partners

Your agency, autonomy, and voice matter in every session.
