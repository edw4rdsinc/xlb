## FAQ Section

**Section Headline:**
Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How long does it take to get an appointment?

**A:** It depends on current availability. Typically, I can schedule your first session within 1-2 weeks of your initial consultation. If you need more immediate support, I'm happy to provide referrals to other therapists with sooner availability.

---

### Q: Do you offer a free consultation?

**A:** Yes! I offer a free 15-minute phone consultation so we can discuss your needs and determine if we're a good fit. There's no cost and no obligation.

---

### Q: Do you accept insurance?

**A:** I accept [insurance plans TBD]. For out-of-network insurance, I can provide a superbill for you to submit for reimbursement. I also offer a limited number of sliding scale spots for clients experiencing financial hardship.

---

### Q: What types of therapy do you offer?

**A:** I specialize in evidence-based approaches including:
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
- Trauma-informed care
- Hoarding disorder treatment (PhD-level specialization)

My approach is integrative, meaning I tailor treatment to your specific needs rather than using a one-size-fits-all method.

---

### Q: Do you offer telehealth sessions?

**A:** Yes! I offer both telehealth and in-person sessions. Many clients prefer telehealth for convenience and flexibility, while others prefer in-person connection. We can discuss what works best for you.

---

### Q: How long are therapy sessions?

**A:** Standard therapy sessions are 50 minutes. Your first session may run slightly longer (60 minutes) to allow time for intake and paperwork.

---

### Q: How often will we meet?

**A:** Most clients meet weekly, especially in the beginning. As you progress, we may transition to bi-weekly or monthly sessions. We'll discuss frequency based on your needs and goals.

---

### Q: What should I expect in the first session?

**A:** The first session is all about getting to know each other. We'll discuss:
- What brings you to therapy
- Your history and background
- Your goals for therapy
- How I work and what to expect

You're welcome to ask me any questions about my approach, experience, or the therapeutic process.

---

### Q: Is therapy confidential?

**A:** Yes, therapy is confidential with limited exceptions required by law (e.g., if there's imminent risk of harm to yourself or others, or suspected child/elder abuse). I'll review confidentiality limits in detail during your first session.

---

### Q: What if we're not a good fit?

**A:** That's completely okay! Fit matters in therapy, and I'd much rather help you find the right therapist than continue if we're not a match. I'm happy to provide referrals to other therapists who might be a better fit.

---

### Q: Do you offer clinical supervision?

**A:** Yes! I provide individual and group clinical supervision for LPC Associates in Oregon and Washington seeking licensure supervision. I also offer consultation for licensed therapists seeking specialized guidance. [Learn more about clinical supervision →]

---

### Q: Can I switch between telehealth and in-person?

**A:** Absolutely. Many clients do a mix of both depending on their schedule, weather, or personal preference. We can discuss what works best for you.

---

### Q: What's your cancellation policy?

**A:** I require 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling. Late cancellations (less than 24 hours notice) may be charged the full session fee unless due to emergency or illness.
